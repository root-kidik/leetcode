> [!question] 
> You are given an array of `n` strings `strs`, all of the same length.
> 
> The strings can be arranged such that there is one on each line, making a grid.
> - For example, `strs = ["abc", "bce", "cae"]` can be arranged as follows:
> 
> abc
> bce
> cae
> 
> You want to **delete** the columns that are **not sorted lexicographically**. In the above example (**0-indexed**), columns 0 (`'a'`, `'b'`, `'c'`) and 2 (`'c'`, `'e'`, `'e'`) are sorted, while column 1 (`'b'`, `'c'`, `'a'`) is not, so you would delete column 1.
> 
> Return _the number of columns that you will delete_. 

> [!example] 
> **Input:** strs = ["cba","daf","ghi"]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The grid looks as follows:
  cba
  daf
  ghi
Columns 0 and 2 are sorted, but column 1 is not, so you only need to delete 1 column. 

> [!example] 
> **Input:** strs = ["a","b"]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The grid looks as follows:
  a
  b
Column 0 is the only column and is sorted, so you will not delete any columns. 

> [!example] 
> **Input:** strs = ["zyx","wvu","tsr"]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The grid looks as follows:
  zyx
  wvu
  tsr
All 3 columns are not sorted, so you will delete all 3. 

> [!info] 
> - `n == strs.length`
> - `1 <= n <= 100`
> - `1 <= strs[i].length <= 1000`
> - `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters. 

___

> [!tip] 
> - traverse colums
> ```cpp
> arr[j][i]
> ```
> - reverse max `index`
> - `i`: `arr[0].size()`
> - `j`: `arr.size()`

___

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDeletionSize(vector<string>& strs) {
        auto R{strs.size()};
        auto C{strs[0].size()};

        int r{};
        for (int i{}; i < C; i++)
            for (int j{}; j < R - 1; j++)
                if (strs[j][i] > strs[j + 1][i])
                {
                    r++;
                    break;
                }
        
        return r;
    }
