> [!question] 
> You are given an `8 x 8` **matrix** representing a chessboard. There is **exactly one** white rook represented by `'R'`, some number of white bishops `'B'`, and some number of black pawns `'p'`. Empty squares are represented by `'.'`.
> 
> A rook can move any number of squares horizontally or vertically (up, down, left, right) until it reaches another piece _or_ the edge of the board. A rook is **attacking** a pawn if it can move to the pawn's square in one move.

> [!note] 
> Note: A rook cannot move through other pieces, such as bishops or pawns. This means a rook cannot attack a pawn if there is another piece blocking the path.
> 
> Return the **number of pawns** the white rook is **attacking**. 
> [!example]

**Output:** 3
**Explanation:**
The rook is attacking the pawns at positions b5, d6, and f5.
