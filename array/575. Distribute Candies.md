> [!question] 
> Alice has `n` candies, where the `ith` candy is of type `candyType[i]`. Alice noticed that she started to gain weight, so she visited a doctor.
> 
> The doctor advised Alice to only eat `n / 2` of the candies she has (`n` is always even). Alice likes her candies very much, and she wants to eat the maximum number of different types of candies while still following the doctor's advice.
> 
> Given the integer array `candyType` of length `n`, return _the **maximum** number of different types of candies she can eat if she only eats_ `n / 2` _of them_. 

> [!example] 
> **Input:** candyType = [1,1,2,2,3,3]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** Alice can only eat 6 / 2 = 3 candies. Since there are only 3 types, she can eat one of each type. 

> [!example] 
> **Input:** candyType = [1,1,2,3]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** Alice can only eat 4 / 2 = 2 candies. Whether she eats types [1,2], [1,3], or [2,3], she still can only eat 2 different types. 

> [!example] 
> **Input:** candyType = [6,6,6,6]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** Alice can only eat 4 / 2 = 2 candies. Even though she can eat 2 candies, she only has 1 type. 

> [!info] 
> - `n == candyType.length`- `2 <= n <= 104`
> - `n` is even.
> - `-105 <= candyType[i] <= 105`

> [!tip] 
> - `std::set` as `unique container`
> - `std::min(maximum, actual);`
