> [!question] 
> You are given `row x col` `grid` representing a map where `grid[i][j] = 1` represents land and `grid[i][j] = 0` represents water.
> 
> Grid cells are connected **horizontally/vertically** (not diagonally). The `grid` is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).
> 
> The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around the island. One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island. 

> [!example] 
> ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/island.png)
> **Input:** grid = [[0,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0]]
**Output:** 16
**Explanation:** The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image above. 

> [!example] 
> **Input:** grid = [[1]]
**Output:** 4 

> [!example] 
> **Input:** grid = [[1,0]]
**Output:** 4 

> [!info] 
> - `row == grid.length`
> - `col == grid[i].length`
> - `1 <= row, col <= 100`
> - `grid[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
> - There is exactly one island in `grid`.
