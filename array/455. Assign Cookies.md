> [!question] 
> Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.
> 
> Each child `i` has a greed factor `g[i]`, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie `j` has a size `s[j]`. If `s[j] >= g[i]`, we can assign the cookie `j` to the child `i`, and the child `i` will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number. 

> [!example] 
> **Input:** g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1. 

> [!example] 
> **Input:** g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2. 


> [!info] 
> - `1 <= g.length <= 3 * 104`
> - `0 <= s.length <= 3 * 104`
> - `1 <= g[i], s[j] <= 231 - 1`

> [!tip]
> - `sort` for `greedy` assign 
>  - `pointer` to `child` and `greedy` assign `cookie`
